tumblr2evernote
===============

Scrapes your Tumblr to a bunch of flat HTML files (with YAML front matter) that you can then add to your Evernote or somewhere else.

Usage: 

    ./tumblr2evernote.py myblog.tumblr.com

The included applescript file adds the HTML files into Evernote, preserving the created date.
